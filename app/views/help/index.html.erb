          <b>Viewing Projects:</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          The Projects Overview Page can be accessed by clicking <u>Projects</u> in the navbar.
          This is where all of the organization's projects can be viewed.
          Each project is listed in its own window with the <b>Project Name</b>, <b>Project Description</b>, <b>Project Start Date</b>, and <b>Location</b> shown.
          Each project also has a preview image, which is the first image from the project's <b>Photo Gallery</b>.
          Projects are split into two groups, "Current Projects" and "Past Projects".
          Clicking on <u>Show this Project</u> will take you to the project's unique page.
          At the bottom of the page, a <u>Create a New Project</u> button only visible to admins can be found.
          <br>
          <br>
          Each project's page includes the <b>Project Name</b>, <b>Project Start Date</b>, and <b>Photo Gallery</b> at the top of the page.
          Beneath these elements is the body of the page, which is generated using markdown.
          At the bottom of each page are buttons <u>Edit this Project</u>, <u>Delete this Project</u>, and <u>View other Projects</u>.
          <u>View other Projects</u> returns to the Projects Overview page. The other buttons are only visible to admins.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Creating and Editing Projects:</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          When clicking <u>Create a New Project</u> and <u>Edit this Project</u> you are taken to a new page where you can enter information about the project.
          A project can only be created or updated if sufficient information is provided. If the provided information is insufficient, an alert will inform you of what is needed.
          The <b>Project Name</b>, <b>Project Description</b>, <b>Location</b>, and <b>Project Start Date</b> fields are the contents displayed on the Projects Overview page.
          The <b>Is the Project Active?</b> field determines whether the project is listed under "Current Projects" or "Past Projects".
          Lastly, the <b>Markdown Body</b> field is where markdown text can be entered. The appearance of the markdown text can be viewed under the "Markdown Preview" section, which provides a real-time
          preview as the <b>Markdown Body</b> field is updated.
          Once the desired information has been entered, you can press <u>Update Project</u> to finalize your changes. If you are making a new project, this results in a new window for the newly made project
          being shown in the Projects Overview page, and clicking <u>Show this Project</u> opens the project's unique page with the changes reflected. If you are editing a new project, the displayed information
          on both pages is altered to reflect any changes made.
